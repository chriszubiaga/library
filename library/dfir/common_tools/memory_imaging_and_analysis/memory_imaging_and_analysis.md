## Memory Analysis

* [AVML](https://github.com/microsoft/avml) - A portable volatile memory acquisition tool for Linux.
* [Evolve](https://github.com/JamesHabben/evolve) - Web interface for the Volatility Memory Forensics Framework.
* [inVtero.net](https://github.com/ShaneK2/inVtero.net) - Advanced memory analysis for Windows x64 with nested hypervisor support.
* [LiME](https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/LiME) - Loadable Kernel Module (LKM), which allows the acquisition of volatile memory from Linux and Linux-based devices, formerly called DMD.
* [MalConfScan](https://github.com/JPCERTCC/MalConfScan) - MalConfScan is a Volatility plugin extracts configuration data of known malware. Volatility is an open-source memory forensics framework for incident response and malware analysis. This tool searches for malware in memory images and dumps configuration data. In addition, this tool has a function to list strings to which malicious code refers.
* [Memoryze](https://www.fireeye.com/services/freeware/memoryze.html) - Free memory forensic software that helps incident responders find evil in live memory. Memoryze can acquire and/or analyze memory images, and on live systems, can include the paging file in its analysis.
* [Memoryze for Mac](https://www.fireeye.com/services/freeware/memoryze.html) - Memoryze for Mac is Memoryze but then for Macs. A lower number of features, however.
* [MemProcFS] (https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS) - MemProcFS is an easy and convenient way of viewing physical memory as files in a virtual file system.
* [Orochi](https://github.com/LDO-CERT/orochi) - Orochi is an open source framework for collaborative forensic memory dump analysis.
* [Rekall](http://www.rekall-forensic.com/) - Open source tool (and library) for the extraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.
* [Responder PRO](http://www.countertack.com/responder-pro) - Responder PRO is the industry standard physical memory and automated malware analysis solution.
* [Volatility](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility) - Advanced memory forensics framework.
* [Volatility 3](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3) - The volatile memory extraction framework (successor of Volatility)
* [VolatilityBot](https://github.com/mkorman90/VolatilityBot) - Automation tool for researchers cuts all the guesswork and manual tasks out of the binary extraction phase, or to help the investigator in the first steps of performing a memory analysis investigation.
* [VolDiff](https://github.com/aim4r/VolDiff) - Malware Memory Footprint Analysis based on Volatility.
* [WindowsSCOPE](http://www.windowsscope.com/windowsscope-cyber-forensics/) - Memory forensics and reverse engineering tool used for analyzing volatile memory offering the capability of analyzing the Windows kernel, drivers, DLLs, and virtual and physical memory.

## Memory Imaging

* [Belkasoft Live RAM Capturer](http://belkasoft.com/ram-capturer) - Tiny free forensic tool to reliably extract the entire content of the computer’s volatile memory – even if protected by an active anti-debugging or anti-dumping system.
* [Linux Memory Grabber](https://github.com/halpomeranz/lmg/) - Script for dumping Linux memory and creating Volatility profiles.
* [MAGNET DumpIt](https://www.magnetforensics.com/resources/magnet-dumpit-for-windows) - Fast memory acquisition tool for Windows (x86, x64, ARM64). Generate full memory crash dumps of Windows machines.
* [Magnet RAM Capture](https://www.magnetforensics.com/free-tool-magnet-ram-capture/) - Free imaging tool designed to capture the physical memory of a suspect’s computer. Supports recent versions of Windows.
* [OSForensics](http://www.osforensics.com/) - Tool to acquire live memory on 32-bit and 64-bit systems. A dump of an individual process’s memory space or physical memory dump can be done.

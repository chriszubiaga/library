# Digital Forensics and Incident Response

### Digital Forensics

Digital forensics is the investigative process of collecting, analyzing, and preserving electronic evidence to reconstruct and understand events that transpired on digital devices or within computer networks. Forensic analysts meticulously examine digital artifacts, from log files and system memory to storage media, to piece together a comprehensive timeline of activities. This methodical approach aids in uncovering the who, what, when, and how of cyber incidents, supporting legal proceedings and incident response efforts.

### Incident Response

Incident Response (IR) is the orchestrated effort to manage and mitigate the impact of a cybersecurity incident promptly. Whether facing a data breach, malware outbreak, or other malicious activities, incident responders act swiftly to contain, eradicate, and recover from the incident. This involves a coordinated approach, combining technical analysis, communication strategies, and collaboration among cross-functional teams to minimize damage and prevent future occurrences.

# Artifacts

DFIR artifacts are the digital traces left behind during cyber incidents, serving as crucial elements in forensic investigations. These artifacts encompass a wide array of digital evidence that can be analyzed to reconstruct events, identify attackers, and understand the scope and impact of security incidents. Examples of DFIR artifacts include logs, timestamps, file metadata, registry entries, network traffic patterns, memory dumps, and artifacts related to user activity such as login records and application usage. Forensic analysts meticulously examine these artifacts to piece together the timeline of events, determine the attack vector, and gather insights into the methods employed by adversaries. By understanding and interpreting these artifacts, DFIR professionals can unravel the intricacies of cyber incidents, strengthen security postures, and develop proactive strategies to prevent future threats.

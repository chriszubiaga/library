# Pentesting

**Penetration testing**, often referred to as pentesting, is a simulated cyberattack conducted by ethical hackers to assess the vulnerabilities of a system, network, or application. The primary objective is to identify weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them, allowing organizations to fortify their defenses and enhance overall security posture.

This cybersecurity practice involves skilled professionals, armed not with malicious intent, but with a mission to mimic the tactics of cyber adversaries. By emulating real-world attack scenarios, pentesters systematically uncover vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and weaknesses that could be exploited by cybercriminals. The insights gained from these tests enable organizations to address vulnerabilities, implement robust security measures, and stay one step ahead in the ongoing cat-and-mouse game of cybersecurity.
